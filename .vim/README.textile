h1. About This Config

This 'vim' config was derived from git://github.com/scottymoon/vim.git
which was based heavily off of the instructions found here:
http://biodegradablegeek.com/2007/12/using-vim-as-a-complete-ruby-on-rails-ide/#config

Additional colors and tweaks were added based on my preferences.


h2. Installation

<pre><code>  cd ~/
  git://github.com/scottymoon/vim.git .vim
  ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
</code></pre>

*Enjoy!*
